  title: SIO06 Management API
  version: "1.0.0"
  description: |-
    This is the API documentation to manage SIO06 devices via HTTPS.
    This API does not serve metrics. For performance reasons, metrics are served at http://my-io4edge-device:9100/metrics.

    The API is secured with basic auth with a single user name and password.
    - user: "io4edge", default password: "core"

    The password can be changed with the PATCH /users/io4edge/basic_auth endpoint.

    The API is available at https://my-io4edge-device/api/v1

    Performance note: Due to hardware limitations, the initial TLS handshake can take up to 2 seconds.
    Clients should reuse the TLS session where possible to avoid this delay.
