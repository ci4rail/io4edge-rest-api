  summary: Get parameter-set of vehicle wakeup unit
  description: |-
    Get parameter-set version and parameters of the device and list the parameters that are not supported 
    by the firmware or missing in parameter-set.

    Parameters not set by the user will have the default value and will appear in the missing_parameters list.

    Parameters set with invalid values will retain their default value and will appear in the invalid_parameters list.
    Invalid parameters are usually rejected when uploading a new parameter-set. It is however possible, that the
    parameter has been uploaded in a previous version of the firmware, which did not know this parameter. The current firmware
    version might reject the parameter.

    Parameters not supported by the firmware will be ignored and will appear in the unsupported_parameters list.

    Available parameters, with their default values in brackets, are:
    - rel-comid [56575530] - (e.g. "A2F66F23") ComID of TRDP relay sink, in hex notation
    - input-pubhost [] - (e.g. "192.168.66.77:20") destination host of TRDP "inputs". If empty, no inputs are published.
    - input-comid [56575531]- (e.g. "A2F66F24") ComID of TRDP "inputs" source, in hex notation
    - input-pubper [1.0] - (e.g. "3.2") publishing frequency of TRDP "inputs" in Hz

  summary: Load parameter-set of vehicle wakeup unit
  description: |-
    Upload parameter-set to device.

    If any parameter has an invalid value, the whole parameter-set will be rejected and the response will contain the invalid parameter.

    It is possible to upload parameters that are not known by the firmware. These parameters will be ignored. 
    This allows to load a parameter-set that is compatible with multiple firmware versions.

    Client should call parameter-set GET endpoint to check if the parameter-set was applied successfully.
    See GET /parameterset for available parameters and the behaviour for missing, unsupported and invalid parameters.

    The new parameters can be read back immediately after the PUT request, but they will not be applied until the device is restarted.
